# Fuzzy-Support-Vector-Machine-FSVM-with-Distance-Based-Similarity-Measure
This python script aims to determine the maximum or minimum value of a Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM). This  was carried out using the Gaussian membership function and the Distance-Based Similarity Measurement consisting of the Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Minkowsky distance methods.
